For testing purpose and as part of the process to learn .net core framework carefully this is a micro project to prove the architecture of building a web API based on repository pattern and practicing to  implement  design patterns  and apply what I've learnt in SOLID Principles , it's like a prototype of a several API's that I've worked on with authenticate using Identity in ASPNET Core with entity framework core and implementing exception handling middleware with logger services using NLog Library and mapping resources to model with Auto-Mapper, all of that under supervised of senior developers .
